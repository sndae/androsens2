## Android sensor data and GPS visualiser ##

This is it the sequel to the famouse android sensor visualiser. Rewritten from scratch with a nice and fresh ui design. Once again here for free, for fun, for everyone! If you are feed up with all the apps that ask for strange permissions you just found all you need. It will display all available sensors and let you choose which one to watch. Every sensor can be inspected, acceleration, gyroscop, light, barometer, humidity... everything in one free app.

Androsens 2 now supports android wear devices! It contains a companion wear app which is deployed on your wear device.<br>
Available in google play store <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tritop.androsense2'>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tritop.androsense2</a>

Androsens is free! You don't have to pay for it.<br>
